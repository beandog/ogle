Installation
============

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.
     Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     There are three package specific configure options.
       --with-dvdread=path  specify where libdvdread is installed
       --with-libmlib=path     specify where mediaLib is installed
       --with-libjpeg=path     specify where libjpeg is installed

     You might need to use these if you have installed libdvdread,
     mediaLib or libjpeg in a nonstandard location.  Most users will not 
     need togive any of these options.  Look at the output from configure
     to see if it has found the library.  Libdvdread and libjpeg are 
     required for correct operation so configure will issue an error if 
     it fails to find them.  MediaLib on the other hand is optional and
     so ogle will compile fine without it being present. MediaLib is 
     written and provided by Sun and is only available for the Solaris 
     operating system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

For other information about configure or make see their respective 
documentation.
