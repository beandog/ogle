.TH OGLE 1
.SH NAME
ogle \- DVD player with support for DVD menus
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ogle 
[\fB--check\fR] [\fB--debug\fR] [\fB-u <cli|gui>\fR [\fIpath\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ogle is an open source DVD player that supports DVD menus and navigation.
You should be able to play DVDs directly from the DVD drive, a mounted fs,
an image file or a copy on your harddrive.
.br
Keyboard commands are available for navigation if you have 
input foucus in the video window.

See the oglerc man page or @CONFIG_FILE@ file for keybindings.

.br
Screen shots can be saved in Ogle's current working directory as 
screenshoot.jpg.
.br
If you run xscreensaver it will be deactivated every 50 seconds 
(don't use a timeout less than this ;)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\--check\fR
Runs a few checks on the dvd setup and exits
.TP
\fB\--debug\fR
This enables output of extensive debug information.
Use this when sending bug reports.
.TP
\fB\--debug-<all|audio|cli|ctrl|gui|mpeg_ps|mpeg_vs|nav|vout>\fR
These make the specified part(s) of Ogle run inside a GDB (The GNU Debugger)
session. This can be usefull for tracing and crash examination.
.TP
\fB\-u cli\fR [\fIpath\fR]
Start Ogle without the graphical user interface.  This is the default if 
the graphical user interface has not been installed. If \fIpath\fR is given
it attempts to use that as the root of the DVD to play.  If it's left out
then it defaults to /dev/dvd.
.TP
\fB\-u gui\fR [\fIpath\fR]
Start Ogle with a graphical user interface.  This is the default if 
the graphical user interface has been installed. If \fIpath\fR is given
it attempts to use that as the root of the DVD to play and begins playback
immediately.
.TP
The -u options are (of course) mutually exclusive.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
USE_FFB2_YUV2RGB
If you run Ogle on Solaris and have a FFB2 frame buffer (a Creator 3D) 
then you can use its hardware yuv2rgb to gain faster playback speed.  This 
is still experimental code, so be warned.  It is enabled by setting the 
environment variable USE_FFB2_YUV2RGB.
.TP
OGLE_MLIB_SCALEMODE
If mlib is used for scaling of video, OGLE_MLIB_SCALEMODE will decide which type will be used. The available options are:
.br
NEAREST, BILINEAR, BICUBIC and BICUBIC2.
.TP
OGLE_USE_XV
If set to 0, it disables the use of the XVideo extension.
.TP
OGLE_USE_XSHM
If set to 0, it disables the use of the XShm extension.
.TP
OGLE_OSS_RESET_BUG
If set, enables a workaround for buggy OSS audio drivers.
It closes/reopens the audio device instead of resetting it when changing
audio parameters.
.TP
OGLE_OSS_TEST
When set, a few tones will be output in each audio channel everytime the audio parameters change and the OSS audio output driver is used.
