Playing a DVD

  To play a dvd you start ogle.
  A simple player is included in the Ogle main package to start this do.
  'ogle -u cli /dev/sr0' just 'ogle' will do to.
  where you can change /dev/sr0 to point to your dvd reader or a directory
  containing the files of a dvd. (see ogle_gui examples below)

Ogle GUI
  If you install the ogle_gui package you will also have access to a
  graphical user interface
  You start the GUI with 'ogle' _not_ ogle_gui.
  In the menu of ogle_gui which will pop up you choose open and
  type the device name of your dvd drive
  /dev/hdc or wherever it is on your system

  or the path to a copy of the dvd on your hard drive
  /usr/dvdcopy/VIDEO_TS

  or the path to the mounted dvd
  /mnt/dvd or /mnt/dvd/VIDEO_TS

  or choose open disc in the menu
  which will open /dev/sr0 which should point to your dvd device.

  At the moment you have to exit ogle and restart to play another dvd.

Solaris
  If you have a FFB2 frame buffer (a Creator 3D) then you can use it
hardware yuv2rgb to gain faster playback speed.  This is still
exprimental code be warned.  Enable it by setting the environment
variable USE_FFB2_YUV2RGB.

Audio support
  If ALSA is not working on your system, you can fall back to OSS.
Depending on your Linux system, you may need kernel support for it.
If you do not have '/dev/dsp', then load the module 'snd-pcm-oss'.
